Made to theme a minimally installed Debian 12 into a MacOS like KDE plasma system as shown in this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHhhf8kFPuk with as less packages possible
You can Install it by running (In order) :
1. base_o.sh
2. theme_1.sh
3. theme_2.sh
4. albertinst_3.sh
5. albertcust_4.sh

The reason why the script is divided into 5 parts is because you got to configure some things in settings & it was divided to follow the proccess of that video. You can of course run the script all together & customize it later. If you need help with anything you can always create a new issue.
